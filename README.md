This is the repository for the TrackStar project. _TrackStar_ is an efficient way of creating and tracking SMART goals based on the seven pillars of wellness. _TrackStar_ also lets you set calendar reminders to set daily objectives to build and maintain consistency. In the near future, _TrackStar_ will have AI implementation, gamifying features, mobile alerts, and progress reports.
